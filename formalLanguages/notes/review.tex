\section{Chaper 6: Simplification of Context-Free Grammars and Normal Forms}
\subsection{Methods for Transforming Grammars}

So, initially we would like to make claims about a general context-free language. So, to refresh, 
what even is a \textit{context-free language}? Well, it is a language in which there is an initial
state, and every string w in L can be formed by logical operations on the string, which is specified
by the grammar for the language. Thus, a regular language (one able to be defined by an nfa) is a subset
of all context-free languages.

However, there seems to be one problem with context-free languages in general: How do  we deal with the 
empty-string? Usually, we can remove the empty string without too much of a loss in functionality.

We can define a language without the string, and if it is necessary, add an extra state dedicated
to just inserting it in case we need it.
\subsubsection{Theorem 6.1}
Basically this theorem says that if a CFL contains a production of the form

	A $\rightarrow$ $x_1$ B $x_2$

	and B$\rightarrow$ $y_1$ $|$ $y_2$...

Then, we can replace A $\rightarrow$ $x_1$ B$x_2$  with A $\rightarrow$ $x_1$ $y_1$$x_2$$|$...

Then, the language accepted by this new grammar is equivalent to the language accepted by the original one.

This is easy to accept as we are just replacing one implication with another, A and B (or whatever they're called).

\textit{\textbf{useless variables}}: A variable is called useful if it takes part in any derivation. (The book used 
the example of a varable that can be a terminal).
Then, a variable is called useless if there is no way of reaching it from the initial state or if there is no way it 
can lead to a terminal state.
\subsubsection{Theorem 6.2}
Let G=(V,T,S,P) be a context-free grammar. Then there is an equivalent language with no useless variables.

\textbf{\textit{$\lambda$-production}}: a lambda production is one where a state can produce an empty string. This will
then cause the language to lead to a terminal.
\subsubsection{Theorem 6.3}
Let G be a CFL without $\lambda$ in its language. Then, there is an equivalent  language with no $\lambda$-productions.
To make an equivalent language without $\lambda$: We need to see the productions that lead to a lambda; remove the lambda;
and then in every other variable that leads to that  variable, we add the mullabe productions. 
(We create a set of nullable states).
\subsection{6.2:Two Important Normal Forms}
\subsubsection{Chomsky Normal Form}
When we want to study ways of writiing  a grammar, one of the important forms to do this is the Chomsky Normal Form.
The Chomsky Normal Form is when a grammar produces productions with at most two symbols.

For example

\textit{A$\rightarrow$BC} 

\textit{A$\rightarrow$a}
\subsubsection{Greibach Normal Form}
This normal form does not restrict the amount of symbols that can go on the right side of a production, instead 
we deal with the positions of the terminals.
\subsection{6.3: A Membership Algorithm for Context Free Grammars}
Previously we had talked about there being some algorithms to determine membership in a particular language.
Our brute force attempt was just to literally go through all the possible productions and compare them to the 
string we wanted to check. However, there is extists a parsing algorithm that is able to do this as a function 
of the input length in linear time.

The algorithm we use is called the CYK algorithm and only works with Chomsky Normal Form. We basically go through 
every element in the string and are able to determine how to produce it.
\section{Pushdown Automata}
A \textit{pushdown automata} refers to a type of automata that can describe context-free languages. As we saw previously, if we 
are checking a string that can be of an arbitrarily long length, then we would need to have infinite memory. However, we can use 
something like a stack to store information. This would be useful when we have to do some sort of pattern matching.
\subsection{Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata}
To visualize a pushdown automata, we could imagine every symbol of the input file being read by a control unit. The control 
unit could posses the information regarding the states and possible transitions regarding the symbol. On the other side of the
control unit, we could have the stack, into which we put (by usual stack operations) the symbol generated.

\centerline{\textbf{Definition 7.1}}

A non-deterministic pushdown accepter can be described by the tuple :

\centerline{M=\{Q,$\Sigma$, $\Gamma$, $\delta$, $q_0$, z, F\}}

\begin{enumerate}
		\item{\textbf{Q}}: The finite set of internal states of the control unit.
		\item{\textbf{$\Sigma$}}: the input alphabet
		\item{\textbf{$\Gamma$}}: the finite set of symbols of the stack alphabet. 
		\item{\textbf{$\delta$}}: The cross product of Qx($\Sigma$ $\cup$\{$\lambda$\})x$\Gamma$, the transition function.
		\item{\textbf{$q_0$}}: the initial state of the control unit.
		\item{\textbf{z}}: the stack start symbol.
		\item{\textbf{F}}: teh set of final states.
\end{enumerate}
The definition for the delta is kind of complicated. Essentially, it means  that the transition requires an input state from
the set of input states Q, the current state of the control unit, and the symbol that is placed on the stack. All transitions need
the stack to have a nonzero number of elements, because the current state from the stack is required in our transition function.

Then,for exmaple, the transition

\centerline{$\delta$($q_1$, a,b}= {($q_2$, cd), ($q_3$, $\lambda$)}

means that if the current state in the control unit is $q_1$ and an input symbol of a is read, and the symbol on top of the stack
is b, then either of two transitions can happen. We can either go to ($q_2$, cd), in which case the control unit will move to 
state $q_2$, and b is replaced on top of the stack with cd; or, we could have $q_3$ be the next input in the control unit and b
removed from the top of the stack, with no replacement string.
\section{Pushdown Automata and Context-Free Languages}
Our goal is to prove that for every context-free language there is a non-deterministic pushdown automata that
accepts it. To simplify the process, we can sssume the language is presented in Greibach Normal Form (or by 
keeping the terminals on the right side and the current state too.

An argument in Greibach Normal form is of the form:
\centerline{A$\rightarrow$ bC}
\centerline{\textbf{Theorem 7.1}}
For any context-free language L, there exists a non-deterministic finite accepter M such that
L=L(M)

To use poushdown automata and context-free languages, we nee to make a construction where every ipnut symbol in
the input string either adds a single symbol to the stack or removes a single symbol from the stack.
\centerline{\textbf{Theorem 7.2}}
If L=L(M) for some npda M ,, then L is a context-free language.
