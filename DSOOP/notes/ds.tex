\maketitle
Stacks and queues are \textit{dynamic} data structures in which we are constantly modifying the 
elements of a partiular set. In a stack, if we want to remove an item, we ususally remove the 
last element in the stack, and we call it a \textit{last-in-first-out} type of  data structure, 
since the last element to ocme in is the furst element we remove.
