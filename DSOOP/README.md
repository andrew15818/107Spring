# Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming

For this course, the main objective focused on introducing  the c++ 
programming language, and more importantly to introduce and become 
familiar with the Object-Oriented programming model.

The assignments in this course were: 

- Implementing a 3x3 matrix composed of individual (custom) vector objects.
Focused on operator overloading.

- Implementing a basic Linked List which could insert and delete elements quickly.
Using dynamic memory and overloading again.

- Implementing a program which can increase/decrease the brightness of an image in
bmp file format. Throws exceptions if the value of a pixel > 255.

- A hash table which keeps track of patients in a hospital. The main hash table was 
implemented with chaining as a collision resolution strategy.

- The last homework assignment implements a topological sort with information in the 
`sample\ data.txt` file. We first make a graph and implement Depth-First Search to 
obtain the order of the procedure.
