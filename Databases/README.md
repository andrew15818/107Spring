# This repo is for the Introduction to Database systems course

The contents of the course include :

- SQL queries (hw1)

- Implementation of a simple DBMS that supports indexing and primary keys

- A more advanced DBMS which supports `where` clause,
along with several different equality operators.

- Finally, although not in this main repo, the final project involved 
adjusting the DBMS to support join operations between two tables.
