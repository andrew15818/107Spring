#Computer Organization
For this class, the main objective was studying the way that different
computer components worked together, such as the CPU, main memory,
and how instructions were handled at the hardware level.

The assignemnts for this class were all lab assignments, so they are 
hosted on different repositories. They dealt with: designing an ALU, 
designing an ALU with the ability to implement more instructions,
a simple single cycle cpu (based on the MIPS instruction set), and the last one dealing with the basics of
cache.

Maybe I can bring the repos here, to show what we did with my partners.
