# This is my personal repo for the spring semester of the year 107.

This is my repo for the Spring semester of the 2018-2019 School year. 
I live in Hsinchu, Taiwan, and study in National Chiao Tung University.
Hopefully this repo serves as a showcase. 

The classes I took this semester include:

- **Introduction To Database Systems** This class turned out to be a lot harder than I anticipated. For the first assignment,
we practiced SQL queries ranging from basic values to more elaborate requests. For the last two assingments, we simulated a
database capable of supporting entry insertion and retrieval.

- **Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming** Here, the C++ language was introduced, as well as basic object-oriented
programming desing principles. In the latter half, we moved to learning basic data structures and graph algorithms.
 
- **Introduction to Wireless Networks** This course only required notekeeping, so I practiced my very rudimentary LaTex 
skills to review the course materials.

- **Computer Organization** A more detailed look at the hardware-level instruction environment through the MIPS ISA. Projects
involved using the Verilog programming language to model simple digital circuit behavior, as well as a simple pipelined
CPU implementation. 

- **Introduction to Formal Languages** Again mostly notekeeping, this class delved into the question of computability and
the hierarchy of formal languages and their properties. 

- Introduction to Computer Security
