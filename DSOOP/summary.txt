In programming chapter 12, the emphasis is on polymorphism in c++. What
is polymorphism? As the name suggests, it is when a function with the same 
name can take on different functionality depending on the object that calls it.
This is mostly achieved by pointer and references between objects of the derived 
classes and oobjects of the base class.

Suppose we have a base class A, and a derived class B. If both classes have a function
called `void print()`, then when we declare a base class pointer and set it equal to 
a derived object, the call to print() will exectute the base class function call with the 
derived object's data.
